# Contributing to OMRÉ Platform

Thanks for contributing. This repository is designed for long-term development.

## Branching Rules
- **Do not push to `main`.**
- All work should be pushed to **`dev`** or a **feature branch**.
- Recommended feature branch format:
  - `feature/<yourname>-<short-task>`
  - Example: `feature/ali-auth-endpoints`

## Pull Requests (PRs)
- When a milestone is ready, open a PR **from `dev` → `main`**.
- PRs should include:
  - What changed
  - Why it changed
  - How to test it (if applicable)

## Commits
- Write clear commit messages.
- Use short prefixes when possible:
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `docs:` documentation change
  - `chore:` maintenance / setup

## Project Structure
- `client/` = frontend
- `server/` = backend
- `docs/` = architecture notes and semester history

## Expectations
- Keep changes focused to the issue/task you’re working on.
- Ask questions early if requirements are unclear.
