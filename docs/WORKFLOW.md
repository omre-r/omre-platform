# Development Workflow

This repository follows a simple branch-based workflow.

## Rules
- Do NOT push to `main`.
- `main` represents stable, reviewed code.
- `dev` is the active development branch.

## Working on Changes
1. Create a branch from `dev`
2. Commit changes clearly and frequently.
3. Push your branch when ready.

## Merging
- Open a Pull Request into `dev` for review.
- Stable milestones are merged from `dev` into `main` by the maintainer.

## Notes
This repository is designed for long-term, multi-semester development.
